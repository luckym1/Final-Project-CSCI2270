BeerSmith's Dry Irish Stout,          Brad Smith,          5/14/11,          ,          Dry Stout,          Stout,          1.036,          1.05,          1.007,          1.011,          30,          45,          1.8,          2.5,          4,          5,          A very dark roasty bitter creamy ale. The style evolved from attempts to capitalize on the success of London porters but originally reflected a fuller creamier more “stout” body and strength. When a brewery offered a stout and a porter the stout was always the stronger beer (it was originally called a “Stout Porter”). Modern versions are brewed from a lower OG and no longer reflect a higher strength than porters. This is the draught version of what is otherwise known as Irish stout or Irish dry stout. Bottled versions are typically brewed from a significantly higher OG and may be designated as foreign extra stouts (if sufficiently strong). While most commercial versions rely primarily on roasted barley as the dark grain others use chocolate malt black malt or combinations of the three. The level of bitterness is somewhat variable as is the roasted character and the dryness of the finish; allow for interpretation by brewers.,          The dryness comes from the use of roasted unmalted barley in addition to pale malt moderate to high hop bitterness and good attenuation. Flaked unmalted barley may also be used to add creaminess. A small percentage (perhaps 3%) of soured beer is sometimes added for complexity (generally by Guinness only). Water typically has moderate carbonate hardness although high levels will not give the classic dry finish.,          Guinness Draught Stout (also canned) Murphy's Stout Beamish Stout O’Hara’s Celtic Stout Russian River O.V.L.

BeerSmith's Wit,          Brad Smith,          12/11/16,          ,          Witbier,          Belgian and French Ale,          1.044,          1.052,          1.008,          1.012,          10,          20,          2.4,          2.9,          4.5,          5.5,          A refreshing elegant tasty moderatestrength wheat-based ale. A 400-year-old beer style that died out in the 1950s; it was later revived by Pierre Celis at Hoegaarden and has grown steadily in popularity over time. The presence character and degree of spicing and lactic sourness varies. Overly spiced and/or sour beers are not good examples of the style. Coriander of certain origins might give an inappropriate ham or celery character. The beer tends to be fragile and does not age well so younger fresher properly handled examples are most desirable. Most examples seem to be approximately 5% ABV.,          About 50% unmalted wheat (traditionally soft white winter wheat) and 50% pale barley malt (usually Pils malt) constitute the grist. In some versions up to 5-10% raw oats may be used. Spices of freshly-ground coriander and Curaçao or sometimes sweet orange peel complement the sweet aroma and are quite characteristic. Other spices (e.g. chamomile cumin cinnamon Grains of Paradise) may be used for complexity but are much less prominent. Ale yeast prone to the production of mild spicy flavors is very characteristic. In some instances a very limited lactic fermentation or the actual addition of lactic acid is done.,          Hoegaarden Wit St. Bernardus Blanche Celis White Vuuve 5 Brugs Tarwebier (Blanche de Bruges) Wittekerke Allagash White Blanche de Bruxelles Ommegang Witte Avery White Rascal Unibroue Blanche de Chambly Sterkens White Ale Bell’s Winter White Ale Victory Whirlwind Witbier Hitachino Nest White Ale,          383.2901492,          71.96,          212,          5.2,          30,          1.048,          1.01,          Great tasting Wit!

Stronger hoppier and/or roastier version of porter designed as either a historical throwback or an American interpretation of the style. Traditional versions will have a more subtle hop character (often English) while modern versions may be considerably more aggressive. Both types are equally valid. Although a rather broad style open to brewer interpretation it may be distinguished from Stout as lacking a strong roasted barley character. It differs from a brown porter in that a black patent or roasted grain character is usually present and it can be stronger in alcohol. Roast intensity and malt flavors can also vary significantly. May or may not have a strong hop character and may or may not have significant fermentation by-products; thus may seem to have an “American” or “English” character.,          May contain several malts prominently dark roasted malts and grains which often include black patent malt (chocolate malt and/or roasted barley may also be used in some versions). Hops are used for bittering flavor and/or aroma and are frequently UK or US varieties. Water with moderate to high carbonate hardness is typical. Ale yeast can either be clean US versions or characterful English varieties.,          Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter Meantime London Porter Anchor Porter Smuttynose Robust Porter Sierra Nevada Porter Deschutes Black Butte Porter Boulevard Bully!

Classic British ingredients provide the best flavor profile.  History: Accounts of its origins vary but most agree that what became later known as IPA was pale ale prepared for shipment to India in the late 1700s and early 1800s. George Hodgson of the Bow Brewery became well-known as an exporter of IPA during the early 1800s and is the first name frequently mentioned with its popularity. As with all English beers with a long history the popularity and formulation of the product changed over time. Burton breweries with their high-sulfate water were able to successfully brew IPA and began their domination of this market by the 1830s around the time the name India Pale Ale was first used. Strength and popularity declined over time and the style virtually disappeared in the second half of the 20th century. The name was often used to describe pale ales and bitters not anything special (a trend that continues in some modern British examples). The style underwent a craft beer rediscovery in the 1980s and is what is described in these guidelines. Modern examples are inspired by classic versions but shouldn’t be assumed to have an unbroken lineage with the exact same profile. White Shield is probably the example with the longest lineage tracing to the strong Burton IPAs of old and first brewed in 1829. Style Comparison: Generally will have more finish hops and less fruitiness and/or caramel than British pale ales and bitters. Has less hop intensity and a more pronounced malt flavor than typical American versions.,          Pale ale malt. English hops are traditional particularly as finishing hops. Attenuative British ale yeast. Refined sugar may be used in some versions. Some versions may show a sulfate character from Burton-type water but this is not essential to the style.,          Freeminer Trafalgar IPA Fuller's Bengal Lancer IPA Meantime India Pale Ale Ridgeway IPA Summit True Brit IPA Thornbridge Jaipur Worthington White Shield,          160,          72,          212,          5.4,          30,          1.053,          1.012,          #NAME?

Used for extract or partial mash brewing.,          Irish Red Ale,          Irish Beer,          1.036,          1.046,          1.01,          1.014,          18,          28,          2.4,          2.8,          3.8,          5,          An easy-drinking pint often with subtle flavors. Slightly malty in the balance sometimes with an initial soft toffee/caramel sweetness a slightly grainy-biscuity palate and a touch of roasted dryness in the finish. Some versions can emphasize the caramel and sweetness more while others will favor the grainy palate and roasted dryness. History: While Ireland has a long ale brewing heritage the modern Irish Red Ale style is essentially an adaptation or interpretation of the popular English Bitter style with less hopping and a bit of roast to add color and dryness. Rediscovered as a craft beer style in Ireland today it is an essential part of most brewery lineups along with a pale ale and a stout. Style Comparison: A less-bitter and hoppy Irish equivalent to an English Bitter with a dryish finish due to roasted barley. More attenuated with less caramel flavor and body than equivalent-strength Scottish ales.,          Generally has a bit of roasted barley or black malt to provide reddish color and dry roasted finish. Pale base malt.

The clean hop presence can reflect classic or modern American or New World hop varieties with a wide range of characteristics. An average-strength hop-forward pale American craft beer generally balanced to be more accessible than modern American IPAs. History: A modern American craft beer era adaptation of English pale ale reflecting indigenous ingredients (hops malt yeast and water). Prior to the explosion in popularity of IPAs was traditionally the most well-known and popular of American craft beers. Style Comparison: Typically lighter in color cleaner in fermentation by-products and having less caramel flavors than English counterparts. There can be some overlap in color between American pale ale and American amber ale. The American pale ale will generally be cleaner have a less caramelly malt profile less body and often more finishing hops. Less bitterness in the balance and alcohol strength than an American IPA. More balanced and drinkable and less intensely hop-focused and bitter than session-strength American IPAs (aka Session IPAs).,          Pale ale malt typically North American two-row. American or New World hops with a wide range of allowable characteristics. American or English ale yeast (neutral to lightly fruity). Specialty grains may add character and complexity but generally make up a relatively small portion of the grist. Grains that add malt flavor and richness light sweetness and toasty or bready notes are often used (along with late hops) to differentiate brands.,          Ballast Point Grunion Pale Ale Firestone Walker Pale 31 Great Lakes Burning River Sierra Nevada Pale Ale Stone Pale Ale Tröegs Pale Ale,          178.133508,          72,          212,          5.2,          0,          1.047,          1.01,          Mash at 66 C or 151 F.

Well-balanced and clean is a refreshing pint without aggressive flavors. History: An American craft beer style produced by many microbreweries and brewpubs particularly those who cannot produce lagers. Regional variations exist (many US West Coast brewpub examples are more assertive like pale ales) but in most areas this beer is designed as the least challenging beer in their lineup.

Roasty-burnt malt with deep dark or dried fruit flavors and a warming bittersweet finish. Despite the intense flavors the components need to meld together to create a complex harmonious beer not a hot mess. History: A style with a long although not necessarily continuous heritage. Traces roots to strong English porters brewed for export in the 1700s and said to have been popular with the Russian Imperial Court. After the Napoleonic wars interrupted trade these beers were increasingly sold in England. The style eventually all but died out until being popularly embraced in the modern craft beer era both in England as a revival and in the United States as a reinterpretation or re-imagination by extending the style with American characteristics. Style Comparison: Like a black barleywine with every dimension of flavor coming into play. More complex with a broader range of possible flavors than lower-gravity stouts.,          Well-modified pale malt with generous quantities of roasted malts and/or grain.

The sweetness balance and oatmeal impression can vary considerably. History: A variant of nourishing or invalid stouts of the late 1800s using oatmeal in the grist similar to the development of sweet stout that used lactose. An original Scottish version used a significant amount of oat malt. Later went through a shady phase where some English brewers would throw a handful of oats into their parti-gyled stouts in order to legally produce a ‘healthy’ Oatmeal Stout for marketing purposes. Most popular in England between the World Wars was revived in the craft beer era for export which helped lead to its adoption as a popular modern American craft beer style that uses a noticeable (not symbolic) quantity of oats. Style Comparison: Most are like a cross between an Irish Extra Stout and a Sweet Stout with oatmeal added. Several variations exist with the sweeter versions more like a Sweet Stout with oatmeal instead of lactose and the drier versions more like a more nutty flavorful Irish Extra Stout. Both tend to emphasize the body and mouthfeel.,          Pale caramel and dark roasted malts (often chocolate) and grains. Oatmeal or malted oats (5-20% or more) used to enhance fullness of body and complexity of flavor. Hops primarily for bittering. Can use brewing sugars or syrups.

Judge the beer based on the pleasantness and harmony of the resulting combination. The overall uniqueness of the process ingredients used and creativity should be considered. The overall rating of the beer depends heavily on the inherently subjective assessment of distinctiveness and drinkability. Base Style: THE BREWER MAY SPECIFY AN UNDERLYING BEER STYLE. The base style may be a classic style (i.e. a named subcategory from these Style Guidelines) or a broader characterization (e.g. “Porter” or “Brown Ale”). If a base style is declared the style should be recognizable. The beer should be judged by how well the special ingredient or process complements enhances and harmonizes with the underlying style. Overall harmony and drinkability are the keys to presenting a well-made specialty beer. The distinctive nature of the stated specialty ingredients/methods should complement the original style (if declared) and not totally overwhelm it. The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles and ingredients or techniques work well together while others do not make palatable combinations. THE BREWER MUST SPECIFY THE “EXPERIMENTAL NATURE” OF THE BEER (E.G. TYPE OF SPECIAL INGREDIENTS USED PROCESS UTILIZED OR HISTORICAL STYLE BEING BREWED) OR WHY THE BEER DOESN’T FIT AN ESTABLISHED STYLE. For historical styles or unusual ingredients/techniques that may not be known to all beer judges the brewer should provide descriptions of the styles ingredients and/or techniques as an aid to the judges.,          Varies by base style.,          Bell’s Rye Stout Bell’s Eccentric Ale Samuel Adams Triple Bock and Utopias Hair of the Dog Adam Great Alba Scots Pine Tommyknocker Maple Nut Brown Ale Great Divide Bee Sting Honey Ale Stoudt’s Honey Double Mai Bock Rogue Dad’s Little Helper Rogue Honey Cream Ale Dogfish Head India Brown Ale Zum Uerige Sticke and Doppel Sticke Altbier Yards Brewing Company General Washington Tavern Porter Rauchenfels Steinbier Odells 90 Shilling Ale Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale Stone Arrogant Bastard,          160,          72,          212,          5.4,          30,          1.046,          1.01,

Bitter was created as a draught alternative (i.e. running beer) to country-brewed pale ale around the start of the 20th century and became widespread once brewers understood how to “Burtonize” their water to successfully brew pale beers and to use crystal malts to add a fullness and roundness of palate. More evident malt flavor than in an ordinary bitter this is a stronger session-strength ale. Some modern variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU levels are often not adjusted so the versions available in the US often do not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. This style guideline reflects the “real ale” version of the style not the export formulations of commercial products.,          Pale ale amber and/or crystal malts may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts corn or wheat. English hops most typical although American and European varieties are becoming more common (particularly in the paler examples). Characterful English yeast.

Refreshing yet flavorful. Some versions may seem like lower gravity brown porters. May have evolved as one of the elements of early porters. In modern terms the name “mild” refers to the relative lack of hop bitterness (i.e. less hoppy than a pale ale and not so strong). Originally the “mildness” may have referred to the fact that this beer was young and did not yet have the moderate sourness that aged batches had. Somewhat rare in England good versions may still be found in the Midlands around Birmingham. Most are low-gravity session beers in the range 3.1-3.8% although some versions may be made in the stronger (4%+) range for export festivals seasonal and/or special occasions. Generally served on cask; session-strength bottled versions don’t often travel well. A wide range of interpretations are possible.,          Pale English base malts (often fairly dextrinous) crystal and darker malts should comprise the grist. May use sugar adjuncts. English hop varieties would be most suitable though their character is muted.

May seem somewhat like a smaller version of a sweet stout or a sweet version of a dark mild. English brown ales are generally split into sub-styles along geographic lines. Southern English (or “London-style”) brown ales are darker sweeter and lower gravity than their Northern cousins. Developed as a bottled product in the early 20th century out of a reaction against vinous vatted porter and often unpalatable mild. Well suited to London’s water supply. Increasingly rare; Mann’s has over 90% market share in Britain. Some consider it a bottled version of dark mild but this style is sweeter than virtually all modern examples of mild.,          English pale ale malt as a base with a healthy proportion of darker caramel malts and often some roasted (black) malt and wheat malt.

An English seasonal variant of sweet stout that is usually less sweet than the original and relies on oatmeal for body and complexity rather than lactose for body and sweetness. Generally between sweet and dry stouts in sweetness. Variations exist from fairly sweet to quite dry. The level of bitterness also varies as does the oatmeal impression.

Stronger hoppier and/or roastier version of porter designed as either a historical throwback or an American interpretation of the style. Traditional versions will have a more subtle hop character (often English) while modern versions may be considerably more aggressive. Both types are equally valid. Although a rather broad style open to brewer interpretation it may be distinguished from Stout as lacking a strong roasted barley character. It differs from a brown porter in that a black patent or roasted grain character is usually present and it can be stronger in alcohol. Roast intensity and malt flavors can also vary significantly. May or may not have a strong hop character and may or may not have significant fermentation by-products; thus may seem to have an “American” or “English” character.,          May contain several malts prominently dark roasted malts and grains which often include black patent malt (chocolate malt and/or roasted barley may also be used in some versions).

The character of a krystal weizen is generally fruitier and less phenolic than that of the hefe-weizen.,          By German law at least 50% of the grist must be malted wheat although some versions use up to 70%; the remainder is Pilsner malt. A traditional decoction mash gives the appropriate body without cloying sweetness. Weizen ale yeasts produce the typical spicy and fruity character although extreme fermentation temperatures can affect the balance and produce off-flavors.

Most beers finish fairly dry considering their relatively sweet palate and as such have a different balance than strong Scotch ales. Traditional Scottish session beers reflecting the indigenous ingredients (water malt) with less hops than their English counterparts (due to the need to import them). Long cool fermentations are traditionally used in Scottish brewing. The malt-hop balance is slightly to moderately tilted towards the malt side. Any caramelization comes from kettle caramelization and not caramel malt (and is sometimes confused with diacetyl). Although unusual any smoked character is yeast- or water-derived and not from the use of peatsmoked malts. Use of peat-smoked malt to replicate the peaty character should be restrained; overly smoky beers should be entered in the Other Smoked Beer category (22B) rather than here.,          Scottish or English pale base malt. Small amounts of roasted barley add color and flavor and lend a dry slightly roasty finish. English hops. Clean relatively un-attenuative ale yeast. Some commercial brewers add small amounts of crystal amber or wheat malts and adjuncts such as sugar. The optional peaty earthy and/or smoky character comes from the traditional yeast and from the local malt and water rather than using smoked malts.,          Orkney Dark Island Caledonian 80/- Export Ale Belhaven 80/- (Belhaven Scottish Ale in the US) Southampton 80 Shilling Broughton Exciseman’s 80/- Belhaven St. Andrews Ale McEwan's Export (IPA) Inveralmond Lia Fail Broughton Merlin’s Ale Arran Dark,          143,          72,          212,          5.4,          21,          1.047,          1.009,

Most beers finish fairly dry considering their relatively sweet palate and as such have a different balance than strong Scotch ales. Traditional Scottish session beers reflecting the indigenous ingredients (water malt) with less hops than their English counterparts (due to the need to import them). Long cool fermentations are traditionally used in Scottish brewing. The malt-hop balance is slightly to moderately tilted towards the malt side. Any caramelization comes from kettle caramelization and not caramel malt (and is sometimes confused with diacetyl). Although unusual any smoked character is yeast- or water-derived and not from the use of peatsmoked malts. Use of peat-smoked malt to replicate the peaty character should be restrained; overly smoky beers should be entered in the Other Smoked Beer category (22B) rather than here.,          Scottish or English pale base malt.

The key attributes of the underlying style (if declared) will be atypical due to the addition of special ingredients or techniques; do not expect the base beer to taste the same as the unadulterated version. Judge the beer based on the pleasantness and harmony of the resulting combination. The overall uniqueness of the process ingredients used and creativity should be considered. The overall rating of the beer depends heavily on the inherently subjective assessment of distinctiveness and drinkability. Base Style: THE BREWER MAY SPECIFY AN UNDERLYING BEER STYLE. The base style may be a classic style (i.e. a named subcategory from these Style Guidelines) or a broader characterization (e.g. “Porter” or “Brown Ale”). If a base style is declared the style should be recognizable. The beer should be judged by how well the special ingredient or process complements enhances and harmonizes with the underlying style. Overall harmony and drinkability are the keys to presenting a well-made specialty beer. The distinctive nature of the stated specialty ingredients/methods should complement the original style (if declared) and not totally overwhelm it. The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles and ingredients or techniques work well together while others do not make palatable combinations. THE BREWER MUST SPECIFY THE “EXPERIMENTAL NATURE” OF THE BEER (E.G. TYPE OF SPECIAL INGREDIENTS USED PROCESS UTILIZED OR HISTORICAL STYLE BEING BREWED) OR WHY THE BEER DOESN’T FIT AN ESTABLISHED STYLE. For historical styles or unusual ingredients/techniques that may not be known to all beer judges the brewer should provide descriptions of the styles ingredients and/or techniques as an aid to the judges.,          Varies by base style.,          Bell’s Rye Stout Bell’s Eccentric Ale Samuel Adams Triple Bock and Utopias Hair of the Dog Adam Great Alba Scots Pine Tommyknocker Maple Nut Brown Ale Great Divide Bee Sting Honey Ale Stoudt’s Honey Double Mai Bock Rogue Dad’s Little Helper Rogue Honey Cream Ale Dogfish Head India Brown Ale Zum Uerige Sticke and Doppel Sticke Altbier Yards Brewing Company General Washington Tavern Porter Rauchenfels Steinbier Odells 90 Shilling Ale Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale Stone Arrogant Bastard,          166.493129,          71.96,          212,          5.4,          30,          1.057,          1.015,

English Pale Ale by Gregar,          Pete Gregar,          12/6/11,          Popular all grain setup.  5 Gallon Gott or Igloo cooler as mash tun with false bottom and 7-9 gallon brewpot capable of boiling at least 6 gallons of wort.  Primarily used for single infusion mashes.,          Extra Special/Strong Bitter (English Pale Ale),          English Pale Ale,          1.048,          1.06,          1.01,          1.016,          30,          50,          1.5,          2.4,          4.6,          6.2,          An average-strength to moderately strong English ale. The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales. A rather broad style that allows for considerable interpretation by the brewer. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily “more premium” since best bitters are traditionally the brewer’s finest product). Since beer is sold by strength in the UK these beers often have some alcohol flavor (perhaps to let the consumer know they are getting their due). In England today “ESB” is a brand unique to Fullers; in America the name has been co-opted to describe a malty bitter reddish standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale. Hopping can be English or a combination of English and American. More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with old ales although strong bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter. Fuller’s ESB is a unique beer with a very large complex malt profile not found in other examples; most strong bitters are fruitier and hoppier. Judges should not judge all beers in this style as if they were Fuller’s ESB clones. Some modern English variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters.

The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales. A rather broad style that allows for considerable interpretation by the brewer. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily “more premium” since best bitters are traditionally the brewer’s finest product). Since beer is sold by strength in the UK these beers often have some alcohol flavor (perhaps to let the consumer know they are getting their due). In England today “ESB” is a brand unique to Fullers; in America the name has been co-opted to describe a malty bitter reddish standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale. Hopping can be English or a combination of English and American. More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with old ales although strong bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter. Fuller’s ESB is a unique beer with a very large complex malt profile not found in other examples; most strong bitters are fruitier and hoppier. Judges should not judge all beers in this style as if they were Fuller’s ESB clones. Some modern English variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export.

In modern terms the name “mild” refers to the relative lack of hop bitterness (i.e. less hoppy than a pale ale and not so strong). Originally the “mildness” may have referred to the fact that this beer was young and did not yet have the moderate sourness that aged batches had. Somewhat rare in England good versions may still be found in the Midlands around Birmingham. Most are low-gravity session beers in the range 3.1-3.8% although some versions may be made in the stronger (4%+) range for export festivals seasonal and/or special occasions. Generally served on cask; session-strength bottled versions don’t often travel well. A wide range of interpretations are possible.,          Pale English base malts (often fairly dextrinous) crystal and darker malts should comprise the grist. May use sugar adjuncts.

Some examples can be more malt balanced but this should not override the overall bitter impression. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales. Originally a draught ale served very fresh under no pressure (gravity or hand pump only) at cellar temperatures (i.e. “real ale”). Bitter was created as a draught alternative (i.e. running beer) to country-brewed pale ale around the start of the 20th century and became widespread once brewers understood how to “Burtonize” their water to successfully brew pale beers and to use crystal malts to add a fullness and roundness of palate.

Dry Stout,          Brad Smith,          12/6/11,          Popular all grain setup.  5 Gallon Gott or Igloo cooler as mash tun with false bottom and 7-9 gallon brewpot capable of boiling at least 6 gallons of wort.  Primarily used for single infusion mashes.,          Dry Stout,          Stout,          1.036,          1.05,          1.007,          1.011,          30,          45,          1.8,          2.5,          4,          5,          A very dark roasty bitter creamy ale. The style evolved from attempts to capitalize on the success of London porters but originally reflected a fuller creamier more “stout” body and strength. When a brewery offered a stout and a porter the stout was always the stronger beer (it was originally called a “Stout Porter”). Modern versions are brewed from a lower OG and no longer reflect a higher strength than porters. This is the draught version of what is otherwise known as Irish stout or Irish dry stout. Bottled versions are typically brewed from a significantly higher OG and may be designated as foreign extra stouts (if sufficiently strong). While most commercial versions rely primarily on roasted barley as the dark grain others use chocolate malt black malt or combinations of the three. The level of bitterness is somewhat variable as is the roasted character and the dryness of the finish; allow for interpretation by brewers.,          The dryness comes from the use of roasted unmalted barley in addition to pale malt moderate to high hop bitterness and good attenuation. Flaked unmalted barley may also be used to add creaminess. A small percentage (perhaps 3%) of soured beer is sometimes added for complexity (generally by Guinness only).

American West Coast original. Large shallow open fermenters (coolships) were traditionally used to compensate for the absence of refrigeration and to take advantage of the cool ambient temperatures in the San Francisco Bay area. Fermented with a lager yeast but one that was selected to thrive at the cool end of normal ale fermentation temperatures. This style is narrowly defined around the prototypical Anchor Steam example. Superficially similar to an American pale or amber ale yet differs in that the hop flavor/aroma is woody/minty rather than citrusy malt flavors are toasty and caramelly the hopping is always assertive and a warm-fermented lager yeast is used.,          Pale ale malt American hops (usually Northern Brewer rather than citrusy varieties) small amounts of toasted malt and/or crystal malts. Lager yeast however some strains (often with the mention of “California” in the name) work better than others at the warmer fermentation temperatures (55 to 60°F) used.

Overall harmony and drinkability are the keys to presenting a well-made specialty beer. The distinctive nature of the stated specialty ingredients/methods should complement the original style (if declared) and not totally overwhelm it. The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles and ingredients or techniques work well together while others do not make palatable combinations.

The traditional style of beer from Düsseldorf. ""Alt"" refers to the ""old"" style of brewing (i.e. making top-fermented ales) that was common before lager brewing became popular. Predates the isolation of bottom-fermenting yeast strains though it approximates many characteristics of lager beers. The best examples can be found in brewpubs in the Altstadt (""old town"") section of Düsseldorf. A bitter beer balanced by a pronounced malt richness. Fermented at cool ale temperature (60-65°F) and lagered at cold temperatures to produce a cleaner smoother palate than is typical for most ales. Common variants include Sticke (""secret"") alt which is slightly stronger darker richer and more complex than typical alts. Bitterness rises up to 60 IBUs and is usually dry hopped and lagered for a longer time. Münster alt is typically lower in gravity and alcohol sour lighter in color (golden) and can contain a significant portion of wheat. Both Sticke alt and Münster alt should be entered in the specialty category.",          Grists vary but usually consist of German base malts (usually Pils sometimes Munich) with small amounts of crystal chocolate and/or black malts used to adjust color. Occasionally will include some wheat. Spalt hops are traditional but other noble hops can also be used. Moderately carbonate water. Clean highly attenuative ale yeast.

The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales. A rather broad style that allows for considerable interpretation by the brewer. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily “more premium” since best bitters are traditionally the brewer’s finest product). Since beer is sold by strength in the UK these beers often have some alcohol flavor (perhaps to let the consumer know they are getting their due). In England today “ESB” is a brand unique to Fullers; in America the name has been co-opted to describe a malty bitter reddish standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale. Hopping can be English or a combination of English and American. More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with old ales although strong bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter. Fuller’s ESB is a unique beer with a very large complex malt profile not found in other examples; most strong bitters are fruitier and hoppier. Judges should not judge all beers in this style as if they were Fuller’s ESB clones. Some modern English variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU levels are often not adjusted so the versions available in the US often do not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. English pale ales are generally considered a premium export-strength pale bitter beer that roughly approximates a strong bitter although reformulated for bottling (including containing higher carbonation).,          Pale ale amber and/or crystal malts may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts corn or wheat. English hops most typical although American and European varieties are becoming more common (particularly in the paler examples).

Primarily used for single infusion mashes.,          Dry Stout,          Stout,          1.036,          1.05,          1.007,          1.011,          30,          45,          1.8,          2.5,          4,          5,          A very dark roasty bitter creamy ale. The style evolved from attempts to capitalize on the success of London porters but originally reflected a fuller creamier more “stout” body and strength. When a brewery offered a stout and a porter the stout was always the stronger beer (it was originally called a “Stout Porter”). Modern versions are brewed from a lower OG and no longer reflect a higher strength than porters. This is the draught version of what is otherwise known as Irish stout or Irish dry stout. Bottled versions are typically brewed from a significantly higher OG and may be designated as foreign extra stouts (if sufficiently strong). While most commercial versions rely primarily on roasted barley as the dark grain others use chocolate malt black malt or combinations of the three. The level of bitterness is somewhat variable as is the roasted character and the dryness of the finish; allow for interpretation by brewers.,          The dryness comes from the use of roasted unmalted barley in addition to pale malt moderate to high hop bitterness and good attenuation. Flaked unmalted barley may also be used to add creaminess. A small percentage (perhaps 3%) of soured beer is sometimes added for complexity (generally by Guinness only). Water typically has moderate carbonate hardness although high levels will not give the classic dry finish.,          Guinness Draught Stout (also canned) Murphy's Stout Beamish Stout O’Hara’s Celtic Stout Russian River O.V.L.

Some examples can be more malt balanced but this should not override the overall bitter impression. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales. Originally a draught ale served very fresh under no pressure (gravity or hand pump only) at cellar temperatures (i.e. “real ale”). Bitter was created as a draught alternative (i.e. running beer) to country-brewed pale ale around the start of the 20th century and became widespread once brewers understood how to “Burtonize” their water to successfully brew pale beers and to use crystal malts to add a fullness and roundness of palate. More evident malt flavor than in an ordinary bitter this is a stronger session-strength ale. Some modern variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU levels are often not adjusted so the versions available in the US often do not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. This style guideline reflects the “real ale” version of the style not the export formulations of commercial products.,          Pale ale amber and/or crystal malts may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts corn or wheat. English hops most typical although American and European varieties are becoming more common (particularly in the paler examples). Characterful English yeast.

The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales. A rather broad style that allows for considerable interpretation by the brewer. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily “more premium” since best bitters are traditionally the brewer’s finest product). Since beer is sold by strength in the UK these beers often have some alcohol flavor (perhaps to let the consumer know they are getting their due). In England today “ESB” is a brand unique to Fullers; in America the name has been co-opted to describe a malty bitter reddish standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale. Hopping can be English or a combination of English and American. More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with old ales although strong bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter. Fuller’s ESB is a unique beer with a very large complex malt profile not found in other examples; most strong bitters are fruitier and hoppier. Judges should not judge all beers in this style as if they were Fuller’s ESB clones. Some modern English variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU levels are often not adjusted so the versions available in the US often do not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. English pale ales are generally considered a premium export-strength pale bitter beer that roughly approximates a strong bitter although reformulated for bottling (including containing higher carbonation).,          Pale ale amber and/or crystal malts may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment.

Subdued maltiness throughout leads to a pleasantly refreshing tang in the finish. To the untrained taster easily mistaken for a light lager a somewhat subtle Pilsner or perhaps a blonde ale. Kölsch is an appellation protected by the Kölsch Konvention and is restricted to the 20 or so breweries in and around Cologne (Köln). The Konvention simply defines the beer as a “light highly attenuated hop-accentuated clear topfermenting Vollbier.” Served in a tall narrow 200ml glass called a “Stange.” Each Köln brewery produces a beer of different character and each interprets the Konvention slightly differently. Allow for a range of variation within the style when judging. Note that drier versions may seem hoppier or more bitter than the IBU specifications might suggest. Due to its delicate flavor profile Kölsch tends to have a relatively short shelf-life; older examples can show some oxidation defects. Some Köln breweries (e.g. Dom Hellers) are now producing young unfiltered versions known as Wiess (which should not be entered in this category).,          German noble hops (Hallertau Tettnang Spalt or Hersbrucker). German Pils or pale malt. Attenuative clean ale yeast. Up to 20% wheat may be used but this is quite rare in authentic versions. Water can vary from extremely soft to moderately hard. Traditionally uses a step mash program although good results can be obtained using a single rest at 149°F. Fermented at cool ale temperatures (59-65°F) and lagered for at least a month although many Cologne brewers ferment at 70°F and lager for no more than two weeks.,          PJ Früh Hellers Malzmühle Paeffgen Sion Peters Reissdorf Gaffel Eisenbahn Dourada Goose Island Summertime Alaska Summer Ale Harpoon Summer Beer New Holland Lucid Saint Arnold Fancy Lawnmower Capitol City Capitol Kölsch Shiner Kölsch,          152.4444582,          71.96,          212,          5.2,          0,          1.049,          1.01,          This recipe can produce very different beers depending on the mash and fermentaion temperatures used.

Traditional versions will have a more subtle hop character (often English) while modern versions may be considerably more aggressive. Both types are equally valid. Although a rather broad style open to brewer interpretation it may be distinguished from Stout as lacking a strong roasted barley character. It differs from a brown porter in that a black patent or roasted grain character is usually present and it can be stronger in alcohol. Roast intensity and malt flavors can also vary significantly. May or may not have a strong hop character and may or may not have significant fermentation by-products; thus may seem to have an “American” or “English” character.,          May contain several malts prominently dark roasted malts and grains which often include black patent malt (chocolate malt and/or roasted barley may also be used in some versions).

Traditional Scottish session beers reflecting the indigenous ingredients (water malt) with less hops than their English counterparts (due to the need to import them). Long cool fermentations are traditionally used in Scottish brewing. The malt-hop balance is slightly to moderately tilted towards the malt side. Any caramelization comes from kettle caramelization and not caramel malt (and is sometimes confused with diacetyl). Although unusual any smoked character is yeast- or water-derived and not from the use of peatsmoked malts. Use of peat-smoked malt to replicate the peaty character should be restrained; overly smoky beers should be entered in the Other Smoked Beer category (22B) rather than here.,          Scottish or English pale base malt.

An Edinburgh water profile will suit this beer style.
Tori's Honey Wheat,        Brian Smith,        12/6/11,        Simple Brew Pot with a 5 Gallon Capacity - leaving a workable boil volume of around 4.25 gal.  Used for extract or partial mash brewing.,        Weizen/Weissbier,        German Wheat and Rye Beer,        1.044,        1.052,        1.01,        1.014,        8,        15,        2.5,        2.9,        4.3,        5.6,        A pale spicy fruity refreshing wheatbased ale. A traditional wheat-based ale originating in Southern Germany that is a specialty for summer consumption but generally produced year-round. These are refreshing fast-maturing beers that are lightly hopped and show a unique banana-and-clove yeast character. These beers often don’t age well and are best enjoyed while young and fresh. The version “mit hefe” is served with yeast sediment stirred in; the krystal version is filtered for excellent clarity. Bottles with yeast are traditionally swirled or gently rolled prior to serving. The character of a krystal weizen is generally fruitier and less phenolic than that of the hefe-weizen.,        By German law at least 50% of the grist must be malted wheat although some versions use up to 70%; the remainder is Pilsner malt. A traditional decoction mash gives the appropriate body without cloying sweetness. Weizen ale yeasts produce the typical spicy and fruity character although extreme fermentation temperatures can affect the balance and produce off-flavors. A small amount of noble hops are used only for bitterness.,        Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Schneider Weisse Weizenhell Paulaner Hefe-Weizen Hacker-Pschorr Weisse Plank Bavarian Hefeweizen Ayinger Bräu Weisse Ettaler Weissbier Hell Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Andechser Weissbier Hefetrüb Kapuziner Weissbier Erdinger Weissbier Penn Weizen Barrelhouse Hocking Hills Hefe-Weizen Eisenbahn Weizenbier,        160,        72,        212,        5.4,        30,        1.052,        1.01,        Very smooth very clear and has a white-white head.

Wit,          Brad Smith,          5/14/11,          Popular 10 gallon setup for all grain brewing.  Uses a 10 gallon water cooler as mash tun for single infusion mashes and a 15 gallon brew pot for full size boil of the 12+ gallons of wort.,          Witbier,          Belgian and French Ale,          1.044,          1.052,          1.008,          1.012,          10,          20,          2.4,          2.9,          4.5,          5.5,          A refreshing elegant tasty moderatestrength wheat-based ale. A 400-year-old beer style that died out in the 1950s; it was later revived by Pierre Celis at Hoegaarden and has grown steadily in popularity over time. The presence character and degree of spicing and lactic sourness varies. Overly spiced and/or sour beers are not good examples of the style. Coriander of certain origins might give an inappropriate ham or celery character. The beer tends to be fragile and does not age well so younger fresher properly handled examples are most desirable. Most examples seem to be approximately 5% ABV.,          About 50% unmalted wheat (traditionally soft white winter wheat) and 50% pale barley malt (usually Pils malt) constitute the grist. In some versions up to 5-10% raw oats may be used. Spices of freshly-ground coriander and Curaçao or sometimes sweet orange peel complement the sweet aroma and are quite characteristic. Other spices (e.g. chamomile cumin cinnamon Grains of Paradise) may be used for complexity but are much less prominent. Ale yeast prone to the production of mild spicy flavors is very characteristic. In some instances a very limited lactic fermentation or the actual addition of lactic acid is done.,          Hoegaarden Wit St. Bernardus Blanche Celis White Vuuve 5 Brugs Tarwebier (Blanche de Bruges) Wittekerke Allagash White Blanche de Bruxelles Ommegang Witte Avery White Rascal Unibroue Blanche de Chambly Sterkens White Ale Bell’s Winter White Ale Victory Whirlwind Witbier Hitachino Nest White Ale,          299.9207416,          72,          212,          5.4,          30,          1.049,          1.012,          Great tasting Wit!
