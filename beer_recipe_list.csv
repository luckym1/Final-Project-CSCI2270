BeerSmith's Dry Irish Stout,Brad Smith,,Dry Stout,Stout,1.036,1.05,1.007,1.011,30,45,1.8,2.5,4,5,A very dark roasty bitter creamy ale. The style evolved from attempts to capitalize on the success of London porters but originally reflected a fuller creamier more “stout” body and strength. When a brewery offered a stout and a porter the stout was always the stronger beer (it was originally called a “Stout Porter”). Modern versions are brewed from a lower OG and no longer reflect a higher strength than porters. This is the draught version of what is otherwise known as Irish stout or Irish dry stout. Bottled versions are typically brewed from a significantly higher OG and may be designated as foreign extra stouts (if sufficiently strong). While most commercial versions rely primarily on roasted barley as the dark grain others use chocolate malt black malt or combinations of the three. The level of bitterness is somewhat variable as is the roasted character and the dryness of the finish; allow for interpretation by brewers.,The dryness comes from the use of roasted unmalted barley in addition to pale malt moderate to high hop bitterness and good attenuation. Flaked unmalted barley may also be used to add creaminess. A small percentage (perhaps 3%) of soured beer is sometimes added for complexity (generally by Guinness only). Water typically has moderate carbonate hardness although high levels will not give the classic dry finish.,327.7676606,71.96,212,5.2,30,1.039,1.01
BeerSmith's Wit,Brad Smith,,Witbier,Belgian and French Ale,1.044,1.052,1.008,1.012,10,20,2.4,2.9,4.5,5.5,A refreshing elegant tasty moderatestrength wheat-based ale. A 400-year-old beer style that died out in the 1950s; it was later revived by Pierre Celis at Hoegaarden and has grown steadily in popularity over time. The presence character and degree of spicing and lactic sourness varies. Overly spiced and/or sour beers are not good examples of the style. Coriander of certain origins might give an inappropriate ham or celery character. The beer tends to be fragile and does not age well so younger fresher properly handled examples are most desirable. Most examples seem to be approximately 5% ABV.,About 50% unmalted wheat (traditionally soft white winter wheat) and 50% pale barley malt (usually Pils malt) constitute the grist. In some versions up to 5-10% raw oats may be used. Spices of freshly-ground coriander and Curaçao or sometimes sweet orange peel complement the sweet aroma and are quite characteristic. Other spices (e.g. chamomile cumin cinnamon Grains of Paradise) may be used for complexity but are much less prominent. Ale yeast prone to the production of mild spicy flavors is very characteristic. In some instances a very limited lactic fermentation or the actual addition of lactic acid is done.,383.2901492,71.96,212,5.2,30,1.048,1.01
Brad's Great Lakes Porter,Brad Smith,,Robust Porter,Porter,1.048,1.065,1.012,1.016,25,50,1.8,2.5,4.8,6.5,A substantial malty dark ale with a complex and flavorful roasty character. Stronger hoppier and/or roastier version of porter designed as either a historical throwback or an American interpretation of the style. Traditional versions will have a more subtle hop character (often English) while modern versions may be considerably more aggressive. Both types are equally valid. Although a rather broad style open to brewer interpretation it may be distinguished from Stout as lacking a strong roasted barley character. It differs from a brown porter in that a black patent or roasted grain character is usually present and it can be stronger in alcohol. Roast intensity and malt flavors can also vary significantly. May or may not have a strong hop character and may or may not have significant fermentation by-products; thus may seem to have an “American” or “English” character.,May contain several malts prominently dark roasted malts and grains which often include black patent malt (chocolate malt and/or roasted barley may also be used in some versions). Hops are used for bittering flavor and/or aroma and are frequently UK or US varieties. Water with moderate to high carbonate hardness is typical. Ale yeast can either be clean US versions or characterful English varieties.,440.9999536,71.96,212,5.2,28,1.052,1.018
49th Parallel IPA,Brad Smith,Simple Brew Pot with a 4 Gallon Capacity - leaving a workable boil volume of around 3.25 gal.  Used for extract or partial mash brewing.,English IPA,Pale Commonwealth Beer,1.05,1.075,1.01,1.018,40,60,2,2.8,5,7.5,A hoppy moderately-strong very well-attenuated pale British ale with a dry finish and a hoppy aroma and flavor. Classic British ingredients provide the best flavor profile.  History: Accounts of its origins vary but most agree that what became later known as IPA was pale ale prepared for shipment to India in the late 1700s and early 1800s. George Hodgson of the Bow Brewery became well-known as an exporter of IPA during the early 1800s and is the first name frequently mentioned with its popularity. As with all English beers with a long history the popularity and formulation of the product changed over time. Burton breweries with their high-sulfate water were able to successfully brew IPA and began their domination of this market by the 1830s around the time the name India Pale Ale was first used. Strength and popularity declined over time and the style virtually disappeared in the second half of the 20th century. The name was often used to describe pale ales and bitters not anything special (a trend that continues in some modern British examples). The style underwent a craft beer rediscovery in the 1980s and is what is described in these guidelines. Modern examples are inspired by classic versions but shouldn’t be assumed to have an unbroken lineage with the exact same profile. White Shield is probably the example with the longest lineage tracing to the strong Burton IPAs of old and first brewed in 1829. Style Comparison: Generally will have more finish hops and less fruitiness and/or caramel than British pale ales and bitters. Has less hop intensity and a more pronounced malt flavor than typical American versions.,Pale ale malt. English hops are traditional particularly as finishing hops. Attenuative British ale yeast. Refined sugar may be used in some versions. Some versions may show a sulfate character from Burton-type water but this is not essential to the style.,160,72,212,5.4,30,1.053,1.012
49th Parallel Irish Red Ale,Brad Smith,Simple Brew Pot with a 4 Gallon Capacity - leaving a workable boil volume of around 3.25 gal.  Used for extract or partial mash brewing.,Irish Red Ale,Irish Beer,1.036,1.046,1.01,1.014,18,28,2.4,2.8,3.8,5,An easy-drinking pint often with subtle flavors. Slightly malty in the balance sometimes with an initial soft toffee/caramel sweetness a slightly grainy-biscuity palate and a touch of roasted dryness in the finish. Some versions can emphasize the caramel and sweetness more while others will favor the grainy palate and roasted dryness. History: While Ireland has a long ale brewing heritage the modern Irish Red Ale style is essentially an adaptation or interpretation of the popular English Bitter style with less hopping and a bit of roast to add color and dryness. Rediscovered as a craft beer style in Ireland today it is an essential part of most brewery lineups along with a pale ale and a stout. Style Comparison: A less-bitter and hoppy Irish equivalent to an English Bitter with a dryish finish due to roasted barley. More attenuated with less caramel flavor and body than equivalent-strength Scottish ales.,Generally has a bit of roasted barley or black malt to provide reddish color and dry roasted finish. Pale base malt. Caramel malts were historically imported and more expensive so not all brewers would use them.,160,72,212,5.4,30,1.046,1.01

The clean hop presence can reflect classic or modern American or New World hop varieties with a wide range of characteristics. An average-strength hop-forward pale American craft beer generally balanced to be more accessible than modern American IPAs. History: A modern American craft beer era adaptation of English pale ale reflecting indigenous ingredients (hops malt yeast and water). Prior to the explosion in popularity of IPAs was traditionally the most well-known and popular of American craft beers. Style Comparison: Typically lighter in color cleaner in fermentation by-products and having less caramel flavors than English counterparts. There can be some overlap in color between American pale ale and American amber ale. The American pale ale will generally be cleaner have a less caramelly malt profile less body and often more finishing hops. Less bitterness in the balance and alcohol strength than an American IPA. More balanced and drinkable and less intensely hop-focused and bitter than session-strength American IPAs (aka Session IPAs).,Pale ale malt typically North American two-row. American or New World hops with a wide range of allowable characteristics. American or English ale yeast (neutral to lightly fruity). Specialty grains may add character and complexity but generally make up a relatively small portion of the grist. Grains that add malt flavor and richness light sweetness and toasty or bready notes are often used (along with late hops) to differentiate brands.,178.133508,72,212,5.2,0,1.047,1.01
Brulosopher's Best Blonde Ale,Bright Spot Brewing,,Blonde Ale,Pale American Ale,1.038,1.054,1.008,1.013,15,28,2.4,3,3.8,5.5,Easy-drinking approachable malt-oriented American craft beer often with interesting fruit hop or character malt notes. Well-balanced and clean is a refreshing pint without aggressive flavors. History: An American craft beer style produced by many microbreweries and brewpubs particularly those who cannot produce lagers. Regional variations exist (many US West Coast brewpub examples are more assertive like pale ales) but in most areas this beer is designed as the least challenging beer in their lineup. Style Comparison: Typically has more flavor than American Lagers and Cream Ales. Less bitterness than an American Pale Ale.,Generally all malt but can include up to 25% wheat malt and some sugar adjuncts. Any hop variety can be used. Clean American lightly fruity English or Kölsch yeast. May also be made with lager yeast or cold-conditioned. Some versions may have honey spices and/or fruit added although if any of these ingredients are stronger than a background flavor they should be entered in those specialty categories instead.,156,81,212,5.4,30,1.05,1.01
Yeti Clone Ver 2.0,,Popular 10 gallon setup for all grain brewing.

Roasty-burnt malt with deep dark or dried fruit flavors and a warming bittersweet finish. Despite the intense flavors the components need to meld together to create a complex harmonious beer not a hot mess. History: A style with a long although not necessarily continuous heritage. Traces roots to strong English porters brewed for export in the 1700s and said to have been popular with the Russian Imperial Court. After the Napoleonic wars interrupted trade these beers were increasingly sold in England. The style eventually all but died out until being popularly embraced in the modern craft beer era both in England as a revival and in the United States as a reinterpretation or re-imagination by extending the style with American characteristics. Style Comparison: Like a black barleywine with every dimension of flavor coming into play. More complex with a broader range of possible flavors than lower-gravity stouts.,Well-modified pale malt with generous quantities of roasted malts and/or grain. May have a complex grain bill using virtually any variety of malt. Any type of hops may be used. American or English ale yeast.,313.547507,72,212,5.4,90,1.09,1.005
Muddy Pig Oatmeal Stout,Brian Smith,Simple Brew Pot with a 5 Gallon Capacity - leaving a workable boil volume of around 4.25 gal.  Used for extract or partial mash brewing.,Oatmeal Stout,Dark British Beer,1.045,1.065,1.01,1.018,25,40,2.4,2.9,4.2,5.9,A very dark full-bodied roasty malty ale with a complementary oatmeal flavor. The sweetness balance and oatmeal impression can vary considerably. History: A variant of nourishing or invalid stouts of the late 1800s using oatmeal in the grist similar to the development of sweet stout that used lactose. An original Scottish version used a significant amount of oat malt. Later went through a shady phase where some English brewers would throw a handful of oats into their parti-gyled stouts in order to legally produce a ‘healthy’ Oatmeal Stout for marketing purposes. Most popular in England between the World Wars was revived in the craft beer era for export which helped lead to its adoption as a popular modern American craft beer style that uses a noticeable (not symbolic) quantity of oats. Style Comparison: Most are like a cross between an Irish Extra Stout and a Sweet Stout with oatmeal added. Several variations exist with the sweeter versions more like a Sweet Stout with oatmeal instead of lactose and the drier versions more like a more nutty flavorful Irish Extra Stout. Both tend to emphasize the body and mouthfeel.,Pale caramel and dark roasted malts (often chocolate) and grains. Oatmeal or malted oats (5-20% or more) used to enhance fullness of body and complexity of flavor. Hops primarily for bittering. Can use brewing sugars or syrups.

The overall rating of the beer depends heavily on the inherently subjective assessment of distinctiveness and drinkability. Base Style: THE BREWER MAY SPECIFY AN UNDERLYING BEER STYLE. The base style may be a classic style (i.e. a named subcategory from these Style Guidelines) or a broader characterization (e.g. “Porter” or “Brown Ale”). If a base style is declared the style should be recognizable. The beer should be judged by how well the special ingredient or process complements enhances and harmonizes with the underlying style. Overall harmony and drinkability are the keys to presenting a well-made specialty beer. The distinctive nature of the stated specialty ingredients/methods should complement the original style (if declared) and not totally overwhelm it. The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles and ingredients or techniques work well together while others do not make palatable combinations. THE BREWER MUST SPECIFY THE “EXPERIMENTAL NATURE” OF THE BEER (E.G. TYPE OF SPECIAL INGREDIENTS USED PROCESS UTILIZED OR HISTORICAL STYLE BEING BREWED) OR WHY THE BEER DOESN’T FIT AN ESTABLISHED STYLE.

The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales. A rather broad style that allows for considerable interpretation by the brewer. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily “more premium” since best bitters are traditionally the brewer’s finest product). Since beer is sold by strength in the UK these beers often have some alcohol flavor (perhaps to let the consumer know they are getting their due). In England today “ESB” is a brand unique to Fullers; in America the name has been co-opted to describe a malty bitter reddish standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale. Hopping can be English or a combination of English and American. More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with old ales although strong bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter. Fuller’s ESB is a unique beer with a very large complex malt profile not found in other examples; most strong bitters are fruitier and hoppier. Judges should not judge all beers in this style as if they were Fuller’s ESB clones. Some modern English variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU levels are often not adjusted so the versions available in the US often do not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain.

Some examples can be more malt balanced but this should not override the overall bitter impression. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales. Originally a draught ale served very fresh under no pressure (gravity or hand pump only) at cellar temperatures (i.e. “real ale”). Bitter was created as a draught alternative (i.e. running beer) to country-brewed pale ale around the start of the 20th century and became widespread once brewers understood how to “Burtonize” their water to successfully brew pale beers and to use crystal malts to add a fullness and roundness of palate. More evident malt flavor than in an ordinary bitter this is a stronger session-strength ale. Some modern variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU levels are often not adjusted so the versions available in the US often do not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. This style guideline reflects the “real ale” version of the style not the export formulations of commercial products.,Pale ale amber and/or crystal malts may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts corn or wheat. English hops most typical although American and European varieties are becoming more common (particularly in the paler examples). Characterful English yeast.

Refreshing yet flavorful. Some versions may seem like lower gravity brown porters. May have evolved as one of the elements of early porters. In modern terms the name “mild” refers to the relative lack of hop bitterness (i.e. less hoppy than a pale ale and not so strong). Originally the “mildness” may have referred to the fact that this beer was young and did not yet have the moderate sourness that aged batches had. Somewhat rare in England good versions may still be found in the Midlands around Birmingham. Most are low-gravity session beers in the range 3.1-3.8% although some versions may be made in the stronger (4%+) range for export festivals seasonal and/or special occasions. Generally served on cask; session-strength bottled versions don’t often travel well. A wide range of interpretations are possible.,Pale English base malts (often fairly dextrinous) crystal and darker malts should comprise the grist. May use sugar adjuncts.

Developed as a bottled product in the early 20th century out of a reaction against vinous vatted porter and often unpalatable mild. Well suited to London’s water supply. Increasingly rare; Mann’s has over 90% market share in Britain.

Stronger hoppier and/or roastier version of porter designed as either a historical throwback or an American interpretation of the style. Traditional versions will have a more subtle hop character (often English) while modern versions may be considerably more aggressive. Both types are equally valid. Although a rather broad style open to brewer interpretation it may be distinguished from Stout as lacking a strong roasted barley character. It differs from a brown porter in that a black patent or roasted grain character is usually present and it can be stronger in alcohol. Roast intensity and malt flavors can also vary significantly. May or may not have a strong hop character and may or may not have significant fermentation by-products; thus may seem to have an “American” or “English” character.,May contain several malts prominently dark roasted malts and grains which often include black patent malt (chocolate malt and/or roasted barley may also be used in some versions).

Also known as a “wee heavy.” Fermented at cooler temperatures than most ales and with lower hopping rates resulting in clean intense malt flavors. Well suited to the region of origin with abundant malt and cool fermentation and aging temperature. Hops which are not native to Scotland and formerly expensive to import were kept to a minimum.,Well-modified pale malt with up to 3% roasted barley. May use some crystal malt for color adjustment; sweetness usually comes not from crystal malts rather from low hopping high mash temperatures and kettle caramelization. A small proportion of smoked malt may add depth though a peaty character (sometimes perceived as earthy or smoky) may also originate from the yeast and native water.

Creativity is the only limit in brewing but the entrants must identify what is special about their entry. This category may be used as an “incubator” for recognized styles for which there is not yet a formal BJCP category. ,May include herbs and/or spices. May include unusual grains and malts though the grain character should be apparent if it is a key ingredient. May include adjuncts such as caramelized sugar syrup and honey. May include Belgian microbiota such as Brettanomyces or Lactobacillus. Unusual techniques such as blending may be used through primarily to arrive at a particular result. The process alone does not make a beer unique to a blind judging panel if the final product does not taste different.,204,72,212,5.4,30,1.046,1.01

Smoked Molasses Porter,Kevin Koenig,Popular all grain setup.  5 Gallon Gott or Igloo cooler as mash tun with false bottom and 7-9 gallon brewpot capable of boiling at least 6 gallons of wort.  Primarily used for single infusion mashes.,Other Smoked Beer,Smoke-Flavored and Wood-Aged Beer,1.03,1.11,1.006,1.024,5,70,1.8,3,2.5,12,This is any beer that is exhibiting smoke as a principle flavor and aroma characteristic other than the Bamberg-style Rauchbier (i.e. beechwood-smoked Märzen). Balance in the use of smoke hops and malt character is exhibited by the better examples. The process of using smoked malts more recently has been adapted by craft brewers to other styles notably porter and strong Scotch ales. German brewers have traditionally used smoked malts in bock doppelbock weizen dunkel schwarzbier helles Pilsner and other specialty styles. Any style of beer can be smoked; the goal is to reach a pleasant balance between the smoke character and the base beer style. IF THIS BEER IS BASED ON A CLASSIC STYLE (E.G. ROBUST PORTER) THEN THE SPECIFIC STYLE MUST BE SPECIFIED. CLASSIC STYLES DO NOT HAVE TO BE CITED (E.G. “PORTER” OR “BROWN ALE” IS ACCEPTABLE). THE TYPE OF WOOD OR OTHER SOURCE OF SMOKE MUST BE SPECIFIED IF A “VARIETAL” CHARACTER IS NOTICEABLE. Entries that have a classic style cited will be judged on how well that style is represented and how well it is balanced with the smoke character. Entries with a specific type or types of smoke cited will be judged on how well that type of smoke is recognizable and marries with the base style. Specific classic styles or smoke types do not have to be specified. For example “smoked porter” is as acceptable as “peat-smoked strong Scotch ale” or “cherry-wood smoked IPA.” Judges should evaluate the beers mostly on the overall balance and how well the smoke character enhances the base beer.,Different materials used to smoke malt result in unique flavor and aroma characteristics. Beechwood- peat- or other hardwood (oak maple mesquite alder pecan apple cherry other fruitwoods) smoked malts may be used. The various woods may remind one of certain smoked products due to their food association (e.g. hickory with ribs maple with bacon or sausage and alder with salmon). Evergreen wood should never be used since it adds a medicinal piney flavor to the malt. Excessive peat-smoked malt is generally undesirable due to its sharp piercing phenolics and dirt-like earthiness. The remaining ingredients vary with the base style. If smoked malts are combined with other unusual ingredients (fruits vegetables spices honey etc.) in noticeable quantities the resulting beer should be entered in the specialty/experimental category.,208.8,72,212,5.4,30,1.01,1.005
Orange Rye Porter,Tim Gorman,,Specialty Beer,Specialty Beer,1.03,1.11,1.006,1.024,5,70,1.8,3,2.5,12,A harmonious marriage of ingredients processes and beer. The key attributes of the underlying style (if declared) will be atypical due to the addition of special ingredients or techniques; do not expect the base beer to taste the same as the unadulterated version. Judge the beer based on the pleasantness and harmony of the resulting combination. The overall uniqueness of the process ingredients used and creativity should be considered. The overall rating of the beer depends heavily on the inherently subjective assessment of distinctiveness and drinkability. Base Style: THE BREWER MAY SPECIFY AN UNDERLYING BEER STYLE. The base style may be a classic style (i.e. a named subcategory from these Style Guidelines) or a broader characterization (e.g. “Porter” or “Brown Ale”). If a base style is declared the style should be recognizable. The beer should be judged by how well the special ingredient or process complements enhances and harmonizes with the underlying style. Overall harmony and drinkability are the keys to presenting a well-made specialty beer. The distinctive nature of the stated specialty ingredients/methods should complement the original style (if declared) and not totally overwhelm it. The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles and ingredients or techniques work well together while others do not make palatable combinations. THE BREWER MUST SPECIFY THE “EXPERIMENTAL NATURE” OF THE BEER (E.G. TYPE OF SPECIAL INGREDIENTS USED PROCESS UTILIZED OR HISTORICAL STYLE BEING BREWED) OR WHY THE BEER DOESN’T FIT AN ESTABLISHED STYLE. For historical styles or unusual ingredients/techniques that may not be known to all beer judges the brewer should provide descriptions of the styles ingredients and/or techniques as an aid to the judges.,Varies by base style.,166.493129,71.96,212,5.4,30,1.057,1.015

Light use of oatmeal may give a certain silkiness of body and richness of flavor while heavy use of oatmeal can be fairly intense in flavor with an almost oily mouthfeel. When judging allow for differences in interpretation.,Pale caramel and dark roasted malts and grains. Oatmeal (5-10%+) used to enhance fullness of body and complexity of flavor. Hops primarily for bittering.  Ale yeast.  Water source should have some carbonate hardness.,160,72,212,5.4,30,1.067,1.022
English Pale Ale by Gregar,Pete Gregar,Popular all grain setup.  5 Gallon Gott or Igloo cooler as mash tun with false bottom and 7-9 gallon brewpot capable of boiling at least 6 gallons of wort.  Primarily used for single infusion mashes.,Extra Special/Strong Bitter (English Pale Ale),English Pale Ale,1.048,1.06,1.01,1.016,30,50,1.5,2.4,4.6,6.2,An average-strength to moderately strong English ale. The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales. A rather broad style that allows for considerable interpretation by the brewer. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily “more premium” since best bitters are traditionally the brewer’s finest product). Since beer is sold by strength in the UK these beers often have some alcohol flavor (perhaps to let the consumer know they are getting their due). In England today “ESB” is a brand unique to Fullers; in America the name has been co-opted to describe a malty bitter reddish standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale. Hopping can be English or a combination of English and American. More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with old ales although strong bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter. Fuller’s ESB is a unique beer with a very large complex malt profile not found in other examples; most strong bitters are fruitier and hoppier. Judges should not judge all beers in this style as if they were Fuller’s ESB clones. Some modern English variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU levels are often not adjusted so the versions available in the US often do not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. English pale ales are generally considered a premium export-strength pale bitter beer that roughly approximates a strong bitter although reformulated for bottling (including containing higher carbonation).,Pale ale amber and/or crystal malts may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts corn or wheat. English hops most typical although American and European varieties are becoming more common (particularly in the paler examples). Characterful English yeast. “Burton” versions use medium to high sulfate water.,148,72,212,5.4,30,1.054,1.013

The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales. A rather broad style that allows for considerable interpretation by the brewer. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily “more premium” since best bitters are traditionally the brewer’s finest product). Since beer is sold by strength in the UK these beers often have some alcohol flavor (perhaps to let the consumer know they are getting their due). In England today “ESB” is a brand unique to Fullers; in America the name has been co-opted to describe a malty bitter reddish standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale. Hopping can be English or a combination of English and American. More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with old ales although strong bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter. Fuller’s ESB is a unique beer with a very large complex malt profile not found in other examples; most strong bitters are fruitier and hoppier. Judges should not judge all beers in this style as if they were Fuller’s ESB clones. Some modern English variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU levels are often not adjusted so the versions available in the US often do not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. English pale ales are generally considered a premium export-strength pale bitter beer that roughly approximates a strong bitter although reformulated for bottling (including containing higher carbonation).,Pale ale amber and/or crystal malts may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment.

Originally the “mildness” may have referred to the fact that this beer was young and did not yet have the moderate sourness that aged batches had. Somewhat rare in England good versions may still be found in the Midlands around Birmingham. Most are low-gravity session beers in the range 3.1-3.8% although some versions may be made in the stronger (4%+) range for export festivals seasonal and/or special occasions.

Large shallow open fermenters (coolships) were traditionally used to compensate for the absence of refrigeration and to take advantage of the cool ambient temperatures in the San Francisco Bay area. Fermented with a lager yeast but one that was selected to thrive at the cool end of normal ale fermentation temperatures. This style is narrowly defined around the prototypical Anchor Steam example. Superficially similar to an American pale or amber ale yet differs in that the hop flavor/aroma is woody/minty rather than citrusy malt flavors are toasty and caramelly the hopping is always assertive and a warm-fermented lager yeast is used.,Pale ale malt American hops (usually Northern Brewer rather than citrusy varieties) small amounts of toasted malt and/or crystal malts. Lager yeast however some strains (often with the mention of “California” in the name) work better than others at the warmer fermentation temperatures (55 to 60°F) used.

Originally developed by the Moortgat brewery after WWII as a response to the growing popularity of Pilsner beers. Strongly resembles a Tripel but may be even paler lighter-bodied and even crisper and drier. The drier finish and lighter body also serves to make the assertive hopping and spiciness more prominent. References to the devil are included in the names of many commercial examples of this style referring to their potent alcoholic strength and as a tribute to the original example (Duvel). The best examples are complex and delicate. High carbonation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the perception of a dry finish. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (“refermented in the bottle”).,The light color and relatively light body for a beer of this strength are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white sugar. Noble hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast strains are used – those that produce fruity esters spicy phenolics and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly warmer fermentation temperatures.

The overall rating of the beer depends heavily on the inherently subjective assessment of distinctiveness and drinkability. Base Style: THE BREWER MAY SPECIFY AN UNDERLYING BEER STYLE. The base style may be a classic style (i.e. a named subcategory from these Style Guidelines) or a broader characterization (e.g. “Porter” or “Brown Ale”). If a base style is declared the style should be recognizable. The beer should be judged by how well the special ingredient or process complements enhances and harmonizes with the underlying style. Overall harmony and drinkability are the keys to presenting a well-made specialty beer. The distinctive nature of the stated specialty ingredients/methods should complement the original style (if declared) and not totally overwhelm it. The brewer should recognize that some combinations of base beer styles and ingredients or techniques work well together while others do not make palatable combinations. THE BREWER MUST SPECIFY THE “EXPERIMENTAL NATURE” OF THE BEER (E.G. TYPE OF SPECIAL INGREDIENTS USED PROCESS UTILIZED OR HISTORICAL STYLE BEING BREWED) OR WHY THE BEER DOESN’T FIT AN ESTABLISHED STYLE. For historical styles or unusual ingredients/techniques that may not be known to all beer judges the brewer should provide descriptions of the styles ingredients and/or techniques as an aid to the judges.,Varies by base style.,56,72,212,5.4,30,1.01,1.005
Belguim Brown,Doug,Popular all grain setup.  5 Gallon Gott or Igloo cooler as mash tun with false bottom and 7-9 gallon brewpot capable of boiling at least 6 gallons of wort.  Primarily used for single infusion mashes.,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,Belgian Strong Ale,1.075,1.11,1.01,1.024,20,35,2.3,2.9,8,11,A dark very rich complex very strong Belgian ale. Complex rich smooth and dangerous. Most versions are unique in character reflecting characteristics of individual breweries. Authentic Trappist versions tend to be drier (Belgians would say “more digestible”) than Abbey versions which can be rather sweet and full-bodied. Higher bitterness is allowable in Abbey-style beers with a higher FG. Barleywine-type beers (e.g. Scaldis/Bush La Trappe Quadrupel Weyerbacher QUAD) and Spiced/Christmas-type beers (e.g. N’ice Chouffe Affligem Nöel) should be entered in the Belgian Specialty Ale category (16E) not this category. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (“refermented in the bottle”).,Belgian yeast strains prone to production of higher alcohols esters and sometimes phenolics are commonly used. Water can be soft to hard. Impression of a complex grain bill although many traditional versions are quite simple with caramelized sugar syrup or unrefined sugars and yeast providing much of the complexity. Homebrewers may use Belgian Pils or pale base malt Munich-type malts for maltiness other Belgian specialty grains for character. Caramelized sugar syrup or unrefined sugars lightens body and adds color and flavor (particularly if dark sugars are used). Noble-type English-type or Styrian Goldings hops commonly used. Spices generally not used; if used keep subtle and in the background. Avoid US/UK crystal type malts (these provide the wrong type of sweetness).,296,72,212,5.4,84,1.091,1.024
Brian's Big Belgian,Brian Smith,Simple Brew Pot with a 5 Gallon Capacity - leaving a workable boil volume of around 4.25 gal.  Used for extract or partial mash brewing.,Belgian Golden Strong Ale,Belgian Strong Ale,1.07,1.095,1.005,1.016,22,35,2.3,2.9,7.5,10.5,A golden complex effervescent strong Belgian-style ale. Originally developed by the Moortgat brewery after WWII as a response to the growing popularity of Pilsner beers. Strongly resembles a Tripel but may be even paler lighter-bodied and even crisper and drier. The drier finish and lighter body also serves to make the assertive hopping and spiciness more prominent. References to the devil are included in the names of many commercial examples of this style referring to their potent alcoholic strength and as a tribute to the original example (Duvel). The best examples are complex and delicate. High carbonation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the perception of a dry finish. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (“refermented in the bottle”).,The light color and relatively light body for a beer of this strength are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white sugar. Noble hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast strains are used – those that produce fruity esters spicy phenolics and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly warmer fermentation temperatures. Fairly soft water.,160,72,212,5.4,30,1.078,1.01

The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style; emphasis is still on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales. A rather broad style that allows for considerable interpretation by the brewer. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily “more premium” since best bitters are traditionally the brewer’s finest product). Since beer is sold by strength in the UK these beers often have some alcohol flavor (perhaps to let the consumer know they are getting their due). In England today “ESB” is a brand unique to Fullers; in America the name has been co-opted to describe a malty bitter reddish standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale. Hopping can be English or a combination of English and American. More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with old ales although strong bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter. Fuller’s ESB is a unique beer with a very large complex malt profile not found in other examples; most strong bitters are fruitier and hoppier. Judges should not judge all beers in this style as if they were Fuller’s ESB clones. Some modern English variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden or summer bitters. Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are higher-alcohol versions of their cask (draught) products produced specifically for export. The IBU levels are often not adjusted so the versions available in the US often do not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. English pale ales are generally considered a premium export-strength pale bitter beer that roughly approximates a strong bitter although reformulated for bottling (including containing higher carbonation).,Pale ale amber and/or crystal malts may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment.

Primarily used for single infusion mashes.,Dry Stout,Stout,1.036,1.05,1.007,1.011,30,45,1.8,2.5,4,5,A very dark roasty bitter creamy ale. The style evolved from attempts to capitalize on the success of London porters but originally reflected a fuller creamier more “stout” body and strength. When a brewery offered a stout and a porter the stout was always the stronger beer (it was originally called a “Stout Porter”). Modern versions are brewed from a lower OG and no longer reflect a higher strength than porters. This is the draught version of what is otherwise known as Irish stout or Irish dry stout. Bottled versions are typically brewed from a significantly higher OG and may be designated as foreign extra stouts (if sufficiently strong). While most commercial versions rely primarily on roasted barley as the dark grain others use chocolate malt black malt or combinations of the three. The level of bitterness is somewhat variable as is the roasted character and the dryness of the finish; allow for interpretation by brewers.,The dryness comes from the use of roasted unmalted barley in addition to pale malt moderate to high hop bitterness and good attenuation. Flaked unmalted barley may also be used to add creaminess. A small percentage (perhaps 3%) of soured beer is sometimes added for complexity (generally by Guinness only). Water typically has moderate carbonate hardness although high levels will not give the classic dry finish.,128,72,212,5.4,30,1.039,1.01

The IBU levels are often not adjusted so the versions available in the US often do not directly correspond to their style subcategories in Britain. English pale ales are generally considered a premium export-strength pale bitter beer that roughly approximates a strong bitter although reformulated for bottling (including containing higher carbonation).,Pale ale amber and/or crystal malts may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts corn or wheat. English hops most typical although American and European varieties are becoming more common (particularly in the paler examples). Characterful English yeast. “Burton” versions use medium to high sulfate water.,90.3584391,71.96,212,5.2,30,1.053,1.012
Lloyd's Krispy Kolsch,BIABrewer.info,Sample Brew-In-A-Bag equipment profile set up for a 40 litre electric urn (diameter of 38cm or 15 inches) using a polyester grain bag to hold the grain.  This profile should be used with the BIAB mash profiles available in the BeerSmith mash profiles area. The above assumes loose pellet hops and only clear chilled wort transferred from the kettle using no trub management techniques. Experienced brewers should adjust 'Loss to Trub and Chiller' and 'Brewhouse Efficiency' accordingly to suit their trub management techniques.,Kölsch,Light Hybrid Beer,1.044,1.05,1.007,1.011,20,30,2.4,2.8,4.4,5.2,A clean crisp delicately balanced beer usually with very subtle fruit flavors and aromas. Subdued maltiness throughout leads to a pleasantly refreshing tang in the finish. To the untrained taster easily mistaken for a light lager a somewhat subtle Pilsner or perhaps a blonde ale. Kölsch is an appellation protected by the Kölsch Konvention and is restricted to the 20 or so breweries in and around Cologne (Köln). The Konvention simply defines the beer as a “light highly attenuated hop-accentuated clear topfermenting Vollbier.” Served in a tall narrow 200ml glass called a “Stange.” Each Köln brewery produces a beer of different character and each interprets the Konvention slightly differently. Allow for a range of variation within the style when judging. Note that drier versions may seem hoppier or more bitter than the IBU specifications might suggest. Due to its delicate flavor profile Kölsch tends to have a relatively short shelf-life; older examples can show some oxidation defects. Some Köln breweries (e.g. Dom Hellers) are now producing young unfiltered versions known as Wiess (which should not be entered in this category).,German noble hops (Hallertau Tettnang Spalt or Hersbrucker). German Pils or pale malt. Attenuative clean ale yeast. Up to 20% wheat may be used but this is quite rare in authentic versions. Water can vary from extremely soft to moderately hard. Traditionally uses a step mash program although good results can be obtained using a single rest at 149°F. Fermented at cool ale temperatures (59-65°F) and lagered for at least a month although many Cologne brewers ferment at 70°F and lager for no more than two weeks.,152.4444582,71.96,212,5.2,0,1.049,1.01
Muddy Pig Oatmeal Stout,Brian Smith,Simple Brew Pot with a 5 Gallon Capacity - leaving a workable boil volume of around 4.25 gal.  Used for extract or partial mash brewing.,Oatmeal Stout,Stout,1.048,1.065,1.01,1.018,25,40,1.9,2.5,4.2,5.9,A very dark full-bodied roasty malty ale with a complementary oatmeal flavor. An English seasonal variant of sweet stout that is usually less sweet than the original and relies on oatmeal for body and complexity rather than lactose for body and sweetness. Generally between sweet and dry stouts in sweetness. Variations exist from fairly sweet to quite dry. The level of bitterness also varies as does the oatmeal impression. Light use of oatmeal may give a certain silkiness of body and richness of flavor while heavy use of oatmeal can be fairly intense in flavor with an almost oily mouthfeel. When judging allow for differences in interpretation.,Pale caramel and dark roasted malts and grains. Oatmeal (5-10%+) used to enhance fullness of body and complexity of flavor. Hops primarily for bittering.  Ale yeast.  Water source should have some carbonate hardness.,24.000051,72,212,5.4,30,1.063,1.015
NRB's All Amarillo APA,BIABrewer.info,Based on a 18.5 Gal/70 L pot with a diameter of 18 inches/45 cm and a 9.5 Gal/40 L cooler. The above assumes loose pellet hops and only clear chilled wort transferred from the kettle using no trub management techniques.

An American adaptation of English pale ale reflecting indigenous ingredients (hops malt yeast and water). Often lighter in color cleaner in fermentation by-products and having less caramel flavors than English counterparts. There is some overlap in color between American pale ale and American amber ale. The American pale ale will generally be cleaner have a less caramelly malt profile less body and often more finishing hops.,Pale ale malt typically American two-row. American hops often but not always ones with a citrusy character. American ale yeast. Water can vary in sulfate content but carbonate content should be relatively low. Specialty grains may add character and complexity but generally make up a relatively small portion of the grist. Grains that add malt flavor and richness light sweetness and toasty or bready notes are often used (along with late hops) to differentiate brands.,227.9994779,72,212,5.4,0,1.058,1.012
Nev's Euro-American Premium Lager,BIABrewer.info,Sample Brew-in-a-bag equipment profile set up for a 70 liter brewing pot  (diameter of 45cm or 18 inches) and using a polyester grain bag to hold the grain.  This profile should be used with the BIAB mash profiles available in the BeerSmith mash profiles area. The above assumes loose pellet hops and only clear chilled wort transferred from the kettle using no trub management techniques. Experienced brewers should adjust 'Loss to Trub and Chiller' and 'Brewhouse Efficiency' accordingly to suit their trub management techniques.

Premium beers tend to have fewer adjuncts than standard/lite lagers and can be all-malt. Strong flavors are a fault but premium lagers have more flavor than standard/lite lagers. A broad category of international mass-market lagers ranging from up-scale American lagers to the typical “import” or “green bottle” international beers found in America.,Two- or six-row barley with up to 25% rice or corn as adjuncts.,296.8303898,71.96,212,5.2,30,1.048,1.012
Porter,Brad Smith,Popular all grain setup.  5 Gallon cooler as mash tun with false bottom and 7-9 gallon brewpot capable of boiling at least 6 gallons of wort without spilling over.  Primarily used for single infusion mashes.,Robust Porter,Porter,1.048,1.065,1.012,1.016,25,50,1.8,2.5,4.8,6.5,A substantial malty dark ale with a complex and flavorful roasty character. Stronger hoppier and/or roastier version of porter designed as either a historical throwback or an American interpretation of the style. Traditional versions will have a more subtle hop character (often English) while modern versions may be considerably more aggressive. Both types are equally valid. Although a rather broad style open to brewer interpretation it may be distinguished from Stout as lacking a strong roasted barley character. It differs from a brown porter in that a black patent or roasted grain character is usually present and it can be stronger in alcohol. Roast intensity and malt flavors can also vary significantly. May or may not have a strong hop character and may or may not have significant fermentation by-products; thus may seem to have an “American” or “English” character.,May contain several malts prominently dark roasted malts and grains which often include black patent malt (chocolate malt and/or roasted barley may also be used in some versions). Hops are used for bittering flavor and/or aroma and are frequently UK or US varieties. Water with moderate to high carbonate hardness is typical. Ale yeast can either be clean US versions or characterful English varieties.,176,71.96,212,5.4,30,1.056,1.018
Schwarzbier Lager (Black Beer Ale),BIABrewer.info,Based on a 18.5 Gal/70 L pot with a diameter of 18 inches/45 cm and a 9.5 Gal/40 L cooler. The above assumes loose pellet hops and only clear chilled wort transferred from the kettle using no trub management techniques.

A regional specialty from southern Thuringen and northern Franconia in Germany and probably a variant of the Munich Dunkel style. In comparison with a Munich Dunkel usually darker in color drier on the palate and with a noticeable (but not high) roasted malt edge to balance the malt base. While sometimes called a “black Pils” the beer is rarely that dark; don’t expect strongly roasted porter-like flavors.,German Munich malt and Pilsner malts for the base supplemented by a small amount of roasted malts (such as Carafa) for the dark color and subtle roast flavors.  Noble-type German hop varieties and clean German lager yeasts are preferred,193.280728,72,212,5.4,0,1.05,1.01
Steve's Scottish 80%,Steve Nicholls,Popular all grain setup.  5 Gallon Gott or Igloo cooler as mash tun with false bottom and 7-9 gallon brewpot capable of boiling at least 6 gallons of wort.  Primarily used for single infusion mashes.,Scottish Export 80/-,Scottish and Irish Ale,1.04,1.054,1.01,1.016,15,30,1.5,2.3,3.9,5,Cleanly malty with a drying finish perhaps a few esters and on occasion a faint bit of peaty earthiness (smoke). Most beers finish fairly dry considering their relatively sweet palate and as such have a different balance than strong Scotch ales. Traditional Scottish session beers reflecting the indigenous ingredients (water malt) with less hops than their English counterparts (due to the need to import them). Long cool fermentations are traditionally used in Scottish brewing. The malt-hop balance is slightly to moderately tilted towards the malt side. Any caramelization comes from kettle caramelization and not caramel malt (and is sometimes confused with diacetyl). Although unusual any smoked character is yeast- or water-derived and not from the use of peatsmoked malts. Use of peat-smoked malt to replicate the peaty character should be restrained; overly smoky beers should be entered in the Other Smoked Beer category (22B) rather than here.,Scottish or English pale base malt. Small amounts of roasted barley add color and flavor and lend a dry slightly roasty finish. English hops. Clean relatively un-attenuative ale yeast. Some commercial brewers add small amounts of crystal amber or wheat malts and adjuncts such as sugar. The optional peaty earthy and/or smoky character comes from the traditional yeast and from the local malt and water rather than using smoked malts.,182.7191229,72,212,5.4,30,1.052,1.015
Tori's Honey Wheat,Brian Smith,Simple Brew Pot with a 4 Gallon Capacity - leaving a workable boil volume of around 3.25 gal.  Used for extract or partial mash brewing.,Weizen/Weissbier,German Wheat and Rye Beer,1.044,1.052,1.01,1.014,8,15,2.5,2.9,4.3,5.6,A pale spicy fruity refreshing wheatbased ale. A traditional wheat-based ale originating in Southern Germany that is a specialty for summer consumption but generally produced year-round. These are refreshing fast-maturing beers that are lightly hopped and show a unique banana-and-clove yeast character. These beers often don’t age well and are best enjoyed while young and fresh. The version “mit hefe” is served with yeast sediment stirred in; the krystal version is filtered for excellent clarity. Bottles with yeast are traditionally swirled or gently rolled prior to serving. The character of a krystal weizen is generally fruitier and less phenolic than that of the hefe-weizen.,By German law at least 50% of the grist must be malted wheat although some versions use up to 70%; the remainder is Pilsner malt. A traditional decoction mash gives the appropriate body without cloying sweetness. Weizen ale yeasts produce the typical spicy and fruity character although extreme fermentation temperatures can affect the balance and produce off-flavors. A small amount of noble hops are used only for bitterness.,8.0001346,72,212,5.4,30,1.053,1.013
Wit,Brad Smith,Popular 10 gallon setup for all grain brewing.  Uses a 10 gallon water cooler as mash tun for single infusion mashes and a 15 gallon brew pot for full size boil of the 12+ gallons of wort.,Witbier,Belgian and French Ale,1.044,1.052,1.008,1.012,10,20,2.4,2.9,4.5,5.5,A refreshing elegant tasty moderatestrength wheat-based ale. A 400-year-old beer style that died out in the 1950s; it was later revived by Pierre Celis at Hoegaarden and has grown steadily in popularity over time. The presence character and degree of spicing and lactic sourness varies. Overly spiced and/or sour beers are not good examples of the style. Coriander of certain origins might give an inappropriate ham or celery character. The beer tends to be fragile and does not age well so younger fresher properly handled examples are most desirable. Most examples seem to be approximately 5% ABV.,About 50% unmalted wheat (traditionally soft white winter wheat) and 50% pale barley malt (usually Pils malt) constitute the grist. In some versions up to 5-10% raw oats may be used. Spices of freshly-ground coriander and Curaçao or sometimes sweet orange peel complement the sweet aroma and are quite characteristic. Other spices (e.g. chamomile cumin cinnamon Grains of Paradise) may be used for complexity but are much less prominent. Ale yeast prone to the production of mild spicy flavors is very characteristic. In some instances a very limited lactic fermentation or the actual addition of lactic acid is done.,299.9207416,72,212,5.4,30,1.049,1.012
